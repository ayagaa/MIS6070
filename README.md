A certain lecturer wants to be able to analyze the final percentage scores of his students. The lecturer wants a web application developed so that he can see the mean, the median, and the mode of his students' percentage scores.

The web application should be able to do the following:

View, add, edit, or delete a studentâ€™s name, student number, and final percentage score;

Display a graph showing the mean, the median, and the mode of the percentage scores.

To keep things simple, we can assume the following:

The percentage scores being entered are the final scores - the application should not to be concerned with quiz marks, assignments, etc.

The percentage scores being entered are for the current semester - the application should not be concerned with previous semesters.

The application should only handle one course.

Project Requirements

You can make use of any CSS libraries such as bootstrap, semantic, etc. However, this is completely optional and will not translate to a higher score just because you used one.

You can make use of any Graphing or Charting libraries to draw your graphs.

You must NOT use any front-end JavaScript frameworks (eg. React, Angular, etc). Please ask if you are not sure.

The back-end of the web application MUST be implemented using NODE.js. You can also make use of additional node packages such as Express, handlebars, etc.

Parts of your web application MUST make use of web services.

The data for this web application MUST be stored in a JSON file.
